# iaWriter-Template-dndBeyond-inspired

An [iaWriter template](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates) inspired by the [DnD Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) website.

I made this a personal project for writing DnD adventures in markdown and having them look "pretty nice" once I was ready to run them.

## Formatting Special Blocks

Some of the text blocks such as tables, read-out-loud text, and rules sidebars require a little more than mark-down to get them working. To achieve this I used iaWriter's metadata feature. Here are the metadata tags and type of aside they are used for.

| Block | metadata variable | html |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| read-out-loud | `[%quote]` | <div class=">
| rules aside | `[%note]` |
| | |
| | |

## Work in Progress

This is a personal project; if you find this and decied to use it I make no promisses that it works, that I'll fix things that don't or make improvements. That being said, if something doesn't work or you see somewhere I can improve, let me know. I might get around to it. Or better yet, if you know how to fix or imporve it and you make those improvements share them back, I might merge them in. 

Endjoy and may you always roll nat20s.
